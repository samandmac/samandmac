- 👋 Hi, I’m SA Mac!
- 👀 I’m interested in developing on my coding experience, with a focus on bioinformatics but also learning new programming languages!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Linux, Java, and more about Bioinformatics tools associated with these languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, whether that be me providing assistance (so I can learn more!) or getting assistance from others (also to learn more!)
- 📫 Contact me on here or by email!
